# surveybuilder

Survey Builder creates custom surveys instantly from JSON files

## TODOS:

### Validation and Error Handling:
- Implement robust error handling for file uploads, JSON parsing, and data validation.
- Validate input JSON structure and fields, ensuring they meet expected formats.

### Database Integration:
- Utilize a database (like PostgreSQL) to store survey data instead of using in-memory variables as it is currently done.
- Store survey metadata (title, questions, response options) and user responses separately for better data management and retrieval.

### Unit Testing and Logging:
- Write comprehensive unit tests to validate each endpoint's functionality and logic.
- Implement logging to track system activities, errors, and user interactions for debugging and auditing purposes.

### Deployment:
- Deploy the application on pythonanywhere.com
